# This is for the IDE. We need to duplicate it because the --fast flag doesn’t filter manually enabled linters:
# https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/issues/1909.
# The idea was then to duplicate it, rename to -ide.yaml and reference this file in settings.json. That way, default
# manualy golangci-lint run would run all linters as CI. IDE will only run our fast list.
# However, we can’t use variables like ${workspaceRoot} in settings.json. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/2809.

# Please keep the list in sync.
